# Computer languages

## Definitions

**Extensible Programming** - a style of computer programming that focuses on mechanisms to extend the programming language, compiler, and runtime environment, thus `extending` it's capabilities. 

Pure Compiled Languages: C, C++, C#, Erlang, Rust, Haskell, Go, Fortran, Pascal, Scala, Lisp, 
Interpreted languages: PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Perl/Raku, Tcl
Both(?): Java, Objective-C, 

**Python**  
* artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning processes.  
* extensive libraries and frameworks
* "king of programming languages."  
* Companies using Python: intel, facebook, spotify, netflix, etc.
**Java**  
* desktop apps, mobile apps, web development, AI, cloud apps and more.  
* platform independence
* object-oriented programming
* most secure language
* Companies using Java: Amazon, Adobe, Flipkart, Instagram, etc.
**JavaScript**  
* web-based.  more than 97% of websites use JS on client-side of webpage
* platform independence
* Companies using JavaScript: Microsoft, Uber, PayPal, Google, Walmart, etc.
**Kotlin**  
* language used to develop apps.
* Used by 60% of android developers.
* 100% interoperable. 
* Companies using Kotlin: Pinterest, Uber, Trello, Amazon, etc.
**R**
* language used for statistical and graphical programming.
* Used by statisticians and data miners for data analysis.
* Important for data analysis, financial domans and telecom sectors.
* object-oriented programming language
* cross-platform support
* highly extensible
* companies using R: Flipkart, Amazon, Google, LinkedIn
**PHP**
* general-purpose scripting language
* faster than other scripting languages
* highly secure
* **Go** 
* reliable and efficient programming language
* designed at google in 2007
* supports automation
* facilitates AI and data science processes
* Companies using Go: Google, BBC, Medium, Uber

## C
---
* "general-purpose programming language."
* created: 1972-1973 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs
* standardized: by ANSI since 1989
* influenced which languages: `B` (successor to `B`), `ALGOL 68`, `assembly`, `PL/I`, `FORTRAN`
* inspired which languages: numerous - `C++`, `C--`, `C#`, `Objective-C`, `D`, `Python`, `Perl`, `Go`, `Java`, `JS`, `JS++`, `Rust`, etc...
* uses: works efficiently on games, GUI interfaces, databases and OS, browsers and enterprise applications (such as banking)
* extendable
* enhanced speed and efficiency
* Companies using C: GitHub, Telegram messenger, MasterCard, etc.
---
## Swift
---
* robust programming language developed by Apple
* used to create apps for iOS, watchOS, macOS, and more
* speeds development process
* enhanced performance
* dynamic libraries
* Companies using Swift: Apple, Instragram, Uber, Slack
**C#**
* programming language that runs on .NET framework and is developed by Microsoft
* effective for desktop applications and games
* fully integrated with .NET libraries
* Companies working on C# are Microsoft, Stack Overflow, Accenture, Alibaba Travels
