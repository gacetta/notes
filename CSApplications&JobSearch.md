# Reminder of the Hiring Program Goals

2-4 weeks
50 resumes - 7-10 get back for phone screens - 15-20%.  That's really great
50 resumes - less than 5 get back for phone screens - under 10%.  That's bad - reach out to codesmith

## Codesmith Style App

## Step 1
Apply on Linkdin or company website with a strong online profile or resume

Overall goal: your application is *seen by a decision maker* who can recognize your software engineering ability & invite you to phone interview

- Linkedin/Company websiteL most likely to be seen by internal recruiters - they have the decision making power to invite you to phone interview
- AngelList - most likely to be seen by engineers on the team
- indeed.com/dice/ziprecruiter - external recruiters

## Step 2
Credible & personal application message

Never apply without an application message (cover letter)

LI: "Add message"
Website: "Add cover letter"

4 parts to message:
1. Engineering credibility signal (2x)
2. Your personalized "in" - a personal sincere connection to the (engineering at the) company (1x)
3. Call to action and logistics
4. Overall Style

Hi Calley - the fronend dev role in React at nfl.com caught my eye.  I've really appreciated how early you took on React in the team (i've kept tabs since ~2016) so I'd be fascinated to hear how you've scaled it over time.  I actually spoke at SoCal React on optimizing systems at scale with webpack a week ago.

Most of my work day to day is in React / Redux / Node architecture with specialization in the broader flux paradigm.  Anyway I'd be happy to talk more about the challenges you are working on if you're still looking for folk for the role.  I'm available Wednesday afternoon next week or let me know a time that's good for you

All best - Will

### Credibility Signal (x2)
- OSP (and it's name)
  - snappy 5 word sophisticated description of it
  - seriousness of the problem it solved
  - "response of the dev community has been thrilling"
- Talks or publication s - "Invited to speak on Microservices" (Include talk title)

### Personal sincere connection / interest in the engineering at the company (your 'in')
No effective: 
- something obvious on the job description, 
- non-tech or non-engineering interest/connection *a bonus*

Effective:
- blog post, talks or publications (by company or team member) or glassdoor on engineering culture
- Team: history and background (previous engineering team of employees)
- more unusual tech decisions made / stack (or history of stack) - wappalyzer.com
- likely technical challenge/decision they had to make given their stack or domain

When searching for higher ups: search for the word "engineering"

BONUS: personal connection (shared identity with leadership or values of company, school, culture) - but weave in a more 'technical/engineering in'

### Call to action and logistics (optional)
Optional to inclue:
a strong call to action - suiggestion of specific availability but also show flexibility
  - "i'm available Tues/Wed next week or let me know good times for you"
No references to resume/linkedin in message body
  - appears needy
  - add links in signature instead
Make reference to the specific role - usually in opening so no ambiguity that you're actually applying for the role

### Overall written style of application message
Application message must have the tone of a busy engineer who is:
- confident enough to write a conversational (not casual) email
- sincerely interested enough to have a specific non-obvious 'in' to the company (can't feel like the message was copy/pasted)

Stylistically this can mean:
- appreviations are preferred (AWS, dev & minimize proper noun repetitions)
- Lower case (but also Title Case) can be effective
- Italicising key pieces (e.g talk title and open source product name)
- idioms 'ahead of the game', 'struck a chord', 'brought home for me'
- grammer may be more information
- BUT spelling and grammar should be correct
- dashes & parentheses rather than semi-colons
- if you don't know name, use 'hi there' / 'hi team'
- phrases like 'all best', 'cheers'
- max length: 150 words (target: 120 words)
- humble-confidence "actually I was just invited to speak..."
- "umbrellaizing" - common thread between your 'in' and your 'credibility signal'
- parenthetical credibility inserts

### ChatGPT and the job search

ChatGPT is not a replacement, but a support tool

Recognize that it is not 100% accurate
DO:
1. Use ChatGPT if you're hitting a block
ask "Find me a blog post about distributed systems on the IBM developer blog"
- follow-up: "Are there more advanced ones?"
ask: "What is the tech stack at Roblox and how has it evolved?"

2. Use ChatGPT to inform yourself
Ask: "Give me 10 autotech startups that are currently hiring"
"Can you explain this blog to me in 10 words"
"Tell me the history and missong of Thrive Market"

3. Ensure you're always acting with integrity

### Double-down email
Most times, companies did not see your application because:
- too many apps
- filter by yeasrs of experience, prestige background, intros
- irregular review of apps
- recruiters often can't recognize your ability

Double-down email:
"Hi victoria - I just wante dot send a quick note over.  i've applied for the senior dev role with Handy on Angellist but wanted to let you know directly - here's the message I shared there just so you have it.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Will

[copy/paste original app message]"

Why?  If your application is:
- above the threshold - it is now seen and you are invited to phone screen
- at threshold - you now stand out by bringing it to the company's attention
- below the threshold - you have shown sincere interest and tenacity which may raise you above the threshold



DEETS:
- tiny startup (<50): CEO
- mid-size startup (50-150): CTO or engineering lead for the team you're applying for
- mid-to-large (<400): engineering lead
- large company/FAANG (500+): reach out to an engineer on the team to try to secure and informational interview to earnestly learn about the team and how to get in

Who to send it to:

When to send: same day you apply

Subject line: 'software engineering role', 'Handy dev role', 'engineering role follow-up'
