# Reminder of the Hiring Program Goals

2-4 weeks
50 resumes - 7-10 get back for phone screens - 15-20%.  That's really great
50 resumes - less than 5 get back for phone screens - under 10%.  That's bad - reach out to codesmith

## Codesmith Style App

## Step 1
Apply on Linkdin or company website with a strong online profile or resume

Overall goal: your application is *seen by a decision maker* who can recognize your software engineering ability & invite you to phone interview

- Linkedin/Company websiteL most likely to be seen by internal recruiters - they have the decision making power to invite you to phone interview
- AngelList - most likely to be seen by engineers on the team
- indeed.com/dice/ziprecruiter - external recruiters

## Step 2
Credible & personal application message

Never apply without an application message (cover letter)

LI: "Add message"
Website: "Add cover letter"

4 parts to message:
1. Engineering credibility signal (2x)
2. Your personalized "in" - a personal sincere connection to the (engineering at the) company (1x)
3. Call to action and logistics
4. Overall Style

Hi Calley - the fronend dev role in React at nfl.com caught my eye.  I've really appreciated how early you took on React in the team (i've kept tabs since ~2016) so I'd be fascinated to hear how you've scaled it over time.  I actually spoke at SoCal React on optimizing systems at scale with webpack a week ago.

Most of my work day to day is in React / Redux / Node architecture with specialization in the broader flux paradigm.  Anyway I'd be happy to talk more about the challenges you are working on if you're still looking for folk for the role.  I'm available Wednesday afternoon next week or let me know a time that's good for you

All best - Will

LinkedIn | Github | Resume

### Credibility Signal (x2)
- OSP (and it's name)
  - snappy 5 word sophisticated description of it
  - seriousness of the problem it solved
  - "response of the dev community has been thrilling"
- Talks or publication s - "Invited to speak on Microservices" (Include talk title)

### Personal sincere connection / interest in the engineering at the company (your 'in')
No effective: 
- something obvious on the job description, 
- non-tech or non-engineering interest/connection *a bonus*

Effective:
- blog post, talks or publications (by company or team member) or glassdoor on engineering culture
- Team: history and background (previous engineering team of employees)
- more unusual tech decisions made / stack (or history of stack) - wappalyzer.com
- likely technical challenge/decision they had to make given their stack or domain

When searching for higher ups: search for the word "engineering"

BONUS: personal connection (shared identity with leadership or values of company, school, culture) - but weave in a more 'technical/engineering in'

### Call to action and logistics (optional)
Optional to inclue:
a strong call to action - suiggestion of specific availability but also show flexibility
  - "i'm available Tues/Wed next week or let me know good times for you"
No references to resume/linkedin in message body
  - appears needy
  - add links in signature instead
Make reference to the specific role - usually in opening so no ambiguity that you're actually applying for the role

### Overall written style of application message
Application message must have the tone of a busy engineer who is:
- confident enough to write a conversational (not casual) email
- sincerely interested enough to have a specific non-obvious 'in' to the company (can't feel like the message was copy/pasted)

Stylistically this can mean:
- appreviations are preferred (AWS, dev & minimize proper noun repetitions)
- Lower case (but also Title Case) can be effective
- Italicising key pieces (e.g talk title and open source product name)
- idioms 'ahead of the game', 'struck a chord', 'brought home for me'
- grammer may be more information
- BUT spelling and grammar should be correct
- dashes & parentheses rather than semi-colons
- if you don't know name, use 'hi there' / 'hi team'
- phrases like 'all best', 'cheers'
- max length: 150 words (target: 120 words)
- humble-confidence "actually I was just invited to speak..."
- "umbrellaizing" - common thread between your 'in' and your 'credibility signal'
- parenthetical credibility inserts

### ChatGPT and the job search

ChatGPT is not a replacement, but a support tool

Recognize that it is not 100% accurate
DO:
1. Use ChatGPT if you're hitting a block
ask "Find me a blog post about distributed systems on the IBM developer blog"
- follow-up: "Are there more advanced ones?"
ask: "What is the tech stack at Roblox and how has it evolved?"

2. Use ChatGPT to inform yourself
Ask: "Give me 10 autotech startups that are currently hiring"
"Can you explain this blog to me in 10 words"
"Tell me the history and missong of Thrive Market"

3. Ensure you're always acting with integrity

### Double-down email
Most times, companies did not see your application because:
- too many apps
- filter by yeasrs of experience, prestige background, intros
- irregular review of apps
- recruiters often can't recognize your ability

Double-down email:
"Hi victoria - I just wante dot send a quick note over.  i've applied for the senior dev role with Handy on Angellist but wanted to let you know directly - here's the message I shared there just so you have it.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Will

[copy/paste original app message]"

Why?  If your application is:
- above the threshold - it is now seen and you are invited to phone screen
- at threshold - you now stand out by bringing it to the company's attention
- below the threshold - you have shown sincere interest and tenacity which may raise you above the threshold



DEETS:
- tiny startup (<50): CEO
- mid-size startup (50-150): CTO or engineering lead for the team you're applying for
- mid-to-large (<400): engineering lead
- large company/FAANG (500+): reach out to an engineer on the team to try to secure and informational interview to earnestly learn about the team and how to get in

Who to send it to:

When to send: same day you apply

Subject line: 'software engineering role', 'Handy dev role', 'engineering role follow-up'

Hey there!

I came across a Palantir article while on my latest tech-blog rabbit hole and enjoyed reading about your commitmenet to the OSS community with blueprint.  Some of my favorite projects have been open source - most recently The GraphQL One Stop Shop - a dev tool for real-time data & visual feedback.



don't forget javascript
people and devs

resource heavy - caching is solution

behavioral question - doesn't have to go deep in to tech, more so about behavior

"I prefer to spin up my own implementation of a virtual DOM for a more lightweight approach than React"

Current market trends:

- Forget about FAANG.  Big companies that need a shift for software engineering is where teh $$/opportunities are at
- LLM (Large Language Model) will be a big trend and where the SWEs are needed
- Normal companies are now hiring a bunch of SWEs
- AI is just going to let us build a lot of stuff faster, not replace engineers

Questions to ask at the end of interview:
What's your team structure and size?
Do you use JS or TS and why?
What's your biggest goal for your team to achieve this year?
What's the onboarding experience like?
What level is the position for?
What is your role do you serve for the team?
What's a process on your team that you want to see improved upon?

Design Systems realted questions are helpful
Look into *storybook*

# Job Search Strategy
Referrals (order by effectiveness):
1. Intro by engineer or leader on their team
2. Intro by non-engineer on their team
3. Intro by outside person connected to engineer/leader on their team

Networking Calls / Virtual Coffee
- Focus on people with whom you have an 'in' (school, identity) but you can contact anyone at the company - focus on leaders and engineers (avoid hiring process people)
  - use the Codesmith Alumni Database
- Email about 'learning' and 'careeer path' - but then in person - all the standard rules about credibility signals apply
- Most people are open to this - people very rarely ask for these coffees
  - people want to pay forward in fixed time amounts

Prepare thoughtful (informed - opinoin ) questsion but also focus on conversational and warm style
  - use the 'pre-interview checklist'
Ask for guidance on the application process & if they can let the team know you're applying
*Especially effective when applying to large companies (substitute for Double-down email)*

"I noticed this role....I was curious if there is any formal referral process for the company?"

"I was planning on applying for a role on a particular team.  I was wondering if you have any tips to help my application get seen and moved towards the top of the pile."

## What if you didn't have to apply at all?

Ensure your public online profiles (Angellist, LinkedIn) are perfect
- add profile to HN who's searching (monthly post), Stackoverflow

Apply for private online job platforms (Hired)
- pre-vet you for companies
- make sure to prepare for your application as you would any application

Blog posts - submit to JSDaily, FreeCodeCamp, Hackernoon

Speak at (virtual) meetups (use your tech talks & don't doubt yourself)

Elegant Personal site (seasoned engineer look, not bootcamp grad portfolio site)

Connecting directly with internal recruiters & talen acquisition on LinkedIn, *Engineering team decision-makers (e.g. CTOs)*

## Recruiters
INTERNAL RECRUITERS
- look for terms like: Talent acquisition, Hiring manager, Recruiter @ company
- an important part of your application process: often handle the phone interview
- Think back to the lecture about phone interviews and the goals of recruiters (to impress their boss) but how hard that is from a non-technical background.  Your task is to make it easier for them
  - how?  by coming across as credible

EXTERNAL RECRUITERS
- Mostly doing the same as you - submitting your resume to companies where they have no decision-making power
  - But they're doing it without any of the Codesmith Hiring Program approaches - at best it's 25% as effective as applying yourself

- Not only that, they will promise you a list of companies they work with: creating a false sense of pipeline

## Other things to do when you're exhausted 
Codesmith curriculum
- skill builders and assignments
- hack hours (add in codewars, hackerrank, interviewcake, old hack hours)
- frontend masters

Open Source Product
- Handle pull requests & stretch features
- It's powerful in interview to be working daily on your open source contributions

Take Homes
- Use these instead of tutorials to push you to cement core technologies

*Most important* - iterate on previous interview questions

## Take Home Assignments
DO:
- complete all features
- testing
- submit on time (or communicate that you have timeline / work pressures to navigate)
- use this as the chance to practice your core technologies
- contact your cohortmates or Codesmith team for code review

DON'T:
- have someone else complete the assignment
- give up before you've talked with a team member

## References
Who to ask?
- Phil (OSLabs/Codesmith), OSP Mentors/Fellows, Prior Employers

Brief Your Referee
- What have you communicated to the company
- What's the company focused on
- Mus provide:
 1. What engineering achievements do you want the referee to stress (3)
 2. What are your strengths/weaknesses
 3. How do you work in teams

## Employment Verification and Background Checks
Common for companies to conduct work verifications and background checks around the offer stage
- often done with a 3rd party organization

How to have a successful employment verification process:
- ensure work exp timelines are accurate on your resume and online profiles
- always have integrity in the job search process
- let us know if you have any questions in your hiring channel

OSP / OS Labs Verification
- If you are asked to provide a written verification for your time working on your OSP, reach out in your hiring support channel and we will be able to provide you with a form
