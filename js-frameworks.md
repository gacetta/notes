# What is a framework?

Most websites share a very similar (not to say identical) structure. The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time.

To summarize: there’s no need to reinvent the wheel.

## User interface frameworks
Typically in the frontend domain: aka JavaScript frameworks
- create stylized and professional looking web apps
- most include a grid system to align elements
- color schemes are easily handled
- stylize HTML with CSS to look clean and professional

### Bootstrap
- built by twitter
- easy to learn - easy to spot "bootstrap sites"

### Materialize
- follows Google's Material style guide
- clean looking, bit more "fun" than Bootstrap

### Foundation
- professional looking

### Semantic UI
- lots built in, including themese
- customizable

### Grommet 
- focus on accessibility
- really clean
- made for React JS

## Frontend Frameworks
---
In most cases, written in JS and organize the functionality and interactivity of your website

### Vue
- east to learn
- very fast
- takes parts from Angular and React and optimizes them
- Flexible -- you can ust in a multitude of ways

### AngularJS
- built by Google
- well supported
- huge number of features
- improves application scalability
- difficult to debug
- large learning curve
- part of MEAN stack

### Angular 2+
- built by Google
- well supported
- encourages reusability
- improves application scalability
- large learning curve

### React
- built by Facebook
- bundles frontend code into components
- organizes code and data to make code more reusable
- large learning curve

### Ember - linkedIn
- Gives a large amount of functionality out of the box
- opinionated (you have to use its formatting)
- steep learning curve
---
## Backend Frameworks
---
Much more varied than front-end.  Written in a variety of programming languages and have a wide variety of features.

### Spring MVC
- Java (harder to learn)
- Very Fast
- Less Opinionated

### Django
- Python (easier to learn)
- Happy medium between very opinionated and less structured
- lot of functionality out of the box (user authentication, database, connections, and view rendering)
- Difficult to integrate a fancy front-end
- Python's data handling is amazing

### Flask
- python (easier to learn)
- less opinionated and more customizable than Django
- gives you less out of the box (you've gotta build more)

### Ruby on Rails
- Ruby (easier to learn)
- very opinionated
- great tools like scaffolding so you can build quickly
- lot of functionality out of the box (user authentication, database, connections, and view rendering)
- asset pipeline helps with front-end development
- ruby takes longer to run programs that some other languages

### Meteor
- JavaScript (easier to learn)
- lot of functionality out of the box (user authentication, database, connections, and view rendering)
- Integrates very well with modern front-ends

### Express
- JavaScript (easier to learn)
- very customizable
- very lightweight
- less built-in features
- Node is very fast
