# generic computer code

## micro processing unit / central processor unit (CPU)
- micro processing unit or central proceesor unit - runs the program.
- not very smart, but very very fast
- 3 billion times a second asks "what do I do next?"
- built with capacitors, resistors and transistors
- getting smaller every day

## input devices
- keyboard
- mouse
- touch screen

## output devices
- screen
- speakers
- printer
- DVD burner

## main memory / primary storage
- memory feeds instructions to CPU
- really fast temporary storage
- when powered off, loses storage

## hard drive
- secondary storage
- slower with larger capacity
- stores files when power is off

WE LIVE IN THE MAIN MEMORY
we write the code 

## What happens
we write code, load it into the secondary memory, it is translated into machine code and then fed to the primary storage which feeds it to the CPU
