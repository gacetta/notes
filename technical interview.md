    a. high level overview of your strategy
2. Pseudo Code
    a. Slightly more specific than step 1
    b. should focus on main pieces
    c. helps you to not get lost mid solution
3. Communicate line by line
    a. solid and concise explanation
    b. consistent method of explanation
    c. opportunity to explain why and how the code is working
4. communicate when you don't know something
    a. stack overflow approach
5. Optional summary Explanation

ROADBLOCKS
Stack Overflow Approach
1. What is the problem
2. What did I expect to happen
3. What I have tried
4. Why I expect it's not working

1// Define a function 'memoize' that takes one argument, a function, and returns a function.
2 // When invoked, memoize creates an object that tracks calls to the returned function, where each input is associate with its output.
3 // Every subsequent call to that returned function with the same argument will return the output directly from the object, instead of invoking the original function again.

***Don't ever code a solution and not test it.***

dot notation vs bracket notation
dot references the string to the right of the dot
bracket references the label in the brackets

Read the prompt
1. Ask questions and clarify the prompt.  Are there upper or lower limits to the numbers?  Should I consider an argument of a type other than number?
