# Yarn

`yarn` is an alternate package manager for `Node.js` developed by Facebook.  It isn't technically a replacement for npm since it still relies on modules from the npm registry.

Think of `yarn` as a new installer that still relies upon the same npm structue.  The registry itself hasn't changed, but the installation method is different.
