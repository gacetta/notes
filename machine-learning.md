# History of AI and ML

# Downsides
Data monopolies:
- Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, ISPs, security agencies
- This breaks the dream of independent tech startup able to compete with larger corporations, if access to an essential element is restricted
- Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy (2016)

# What is ML?
- science of getting computers to act in desirable ways without being explicity programmed.  Mostly pattern recognition.
- Based on existing data, computers learn how to predict results in the future on unseen data.
- In a sense it is a form of metaprogramming

# Four Patterns
- Regression: Can our data predict a number?
- Classification: Can our data predict a category?
- Dimensionality Reduction: Can our data be combined into a simpler format? (redundant data)
- Clustering: Can we find natural grouping in our data?

# What is numpy? (Num pie)
- Python library for fast computations with arrays
- Particularly strong at computation with multi-dimensional arrays

# Vocab
- Independent variables / Features: the variables we are using to make a prediciton about another value (Dependent variable / label)
- Dependent variable / label: The variable whose value we are trying to predict
- Data frame: a rectangular structure that stores our data (kind of like an excel sheet or a SQL table). A column corresponds to a feature or the label
- Observation: a row in data frame.  Represents an individual occurence or observation of whatever we are studying.

# Jupyter Notebooks & Literate Programming
Jupyter Notebook is modeled after the age-old tradition of scienticfic lab notebooks.

- Intersperse cells of code with cells

# Python
Few languages for ML and data science:
- R
- Matlab
- Python - gained supremacy due to its simplicity, accessibility and substantial libraries

# Libraries
`Matplotlib` - data visualization library to help understand data, developed from matlab
`Numpy` - math library with powerful multi dimensional array methods
`Keras` - an easy to use artificial neural network library

## Python Basics:
- dynamically typed
- interpreted
- whitespace dependant
- no semicolons
- no braces
- used heavily in scientific research
- language of many machine learning libraries

Data Types
`Tuple` - a list like structure that is immutable.  It can be used to return multiple values
