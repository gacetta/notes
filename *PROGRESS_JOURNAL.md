Paired with Erika Jung - reminded me of the nullish coallescing operator

```
leftExpr ?? rightExpr       // if leftExpr is truthy, returns leftExpr
                            // if leftExpr is falsy, returns rightExpr
```

Use of `.constructor`:

```
const copy = new testObject.constructor  // uses the constructor to make a copy of the datatype
```

- Learned HashTables

- Array.unshift(1, 2, 3) = [1, 2, 3, ...Array] NOT [3, 2, 1, ..Array]

---

# Day 4 - Feb 2

---

- `this.head = this.tail = newNode` assigns both `this.head` and `this.tail` to `newNode`

- hash O(n) solution to Two Sum(numArr, target):

```
hash= {};
iterate over numArr check what number is needed to match to target
if number is in hash - return both indices
otherwise add curr element to hash { element: index}
```

`.repeat()` - string method that constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified numbers of copies of the string on which it was called

approach to binary convertor:
Given a string that represents a Binary Number, write a function that converts this string into a decimal number. DO NOT use the native parseInt() method.

For example:

binToDec('0') -> 0
binToDec('11') -> 3
binToDec('100') -> 4
binToDec('101') -> 5
binToDec('0101') -> 5

```
function binToDec(binString){
    let output = 0;
    for (const digit of binString){
        output *= 2;
        output += Number(digit);
    }
    return output;
```

`console.time(label)` start timer of name label
`console.timeEnd(label)` end timer of name label

---

isPrime() - check all divisors up to Math.sqrt(num) for efficiency

fibonacci bottom up approach:

- APPROACH W/CACHE: cache = {0:0, 1:1}. cache[num] = cache[num - 2] + cache[num - 1]
- APPROACH W/TWO VARIABLES: space: O(1): twoBefore = 0, oneBefore = 1. update values as you go

**factorial could be the same**

"Every single dynamic programming video should start out with the explanation of the subproblem.
This is not about table behind me. Itâ€™s about subproblem and how they relate to each other.

- coinSum2
  dynamic programming solution to "Total Unique Ways to Make Change or 'Coin Change 2' on Leet Code" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4a7cmjZY0

- `element.onclick = function(e) {}` <------ overwrites any existing functionality for click
- `element.addEvenetListener(eventType, function(event) {})` <------- preferred since it ADDS functionality vs overwrites

DOM Tree - "a huge massive object"

      window        <---- window is at higher scope than document
        |
      document
        |
     --html--
     |      |
    head   body

- `setTimeout` returns a `timeoutID` that can be used to end the setTimeout. Same with `setInterval`
  to end - `clearTimeout(timeoutID)`

- got snake working after struggle bus. Remind

# Day 9 - Feb 8

---

helpful eventlistener event types:

- `mouseover` - fired when pointing device is used to move the cursor onto the element or one of its child elements
- `mouseout` - fired when pointing device is used to move the cursor so that it is no longer contained within the element or one of its children

- built a chrome extension!
  Used: Vanilla Dom Manipulation, CSS animations/keyframes/transitions, eventListeners (mouseover), manifest.json (for chrome extension)

---

# Day 10 - Feb 9

---

- `targetElement.insertAdjacentHTML(position, element)`
  insets a given element node at given position relative to the element it is invoked upon
  `targetElement` - the targetElement
  `element` - the element to be inserted in the tree
  `position` - a string representing the position relative to the `targetElement`. Must be one of the following:

1. `beforebegin` - before the targetElement itself
2. `afterbegin` - just inside the targetElement, before its first child
3. `beforeend` - just inside the targetElement, after its first child
4. `afterend` - after the targetElement itself
   **NOTE** all lowercase

- `continue` - terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the loop and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration

- Got 3rd place in chrome extension!

# Day 11 - Feb 10

element.className = 'class1 class2' vs element.classList.add('class1'):

`className` - overwrites all classes (like `setAttribute('class', classNames`)) - use at element creation for multiple classes
`classList` use ALL other times

---

# Day 12 - Feb 11

---

- ES6 computed property names:
  To access object of variable key - `var myObj = {[a]: b};`

- React fragment: `<>`. Instead of returning JSX in <div> tags

-`prop drilling` - when class components "drill" the state down to a lower level for access

- From Nick: check out `useContext` with `useReducer`

CHECK YOUR LOCAL HOST PORT. 3000 !== 8080

Namespace Import:

The following code inserts myModule into the current scope, containing all the exports from the module located at /modules/my-module.js:

`import * as myModule from "/modules/my-module.js";`

Here, myModule represents a namespace object which contains all exports as properties. For example, if the module imported above includes an export doAllTheAmazingThings(), you would call it like this:

`myModule.doAllTheAmazingThings();`

CSV - Comma Separated Values

`flat` method:
`Array.prototype.flat(depth)`

---

`depth` - (optional) the depth level specifying how deep a nested
array structure should be flattened. Defaults to 1

**NOTE:** when you don't know the depth level, you can pass `Infinity` into the `flat()` method to recursively concatenate all elements of the sub-arrays into the new array.

`return value` - a new array

- Binary Tree !== Binary Search Tree

Object.entries - returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.

res.redirect('/path') - equal to GET request to '/path'
res.sendFile('/path.html') - serves path.html page

`/**
*/` - auto starred JS commenting - courtesy of Christopher Long

`Array.prototype.some()` - The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns false. It doesn't modify the array.

OAuth 2.0 Workflow:

1. App sends authorization request to google `authorization` server (for username & profile resources)
   ex: MyApp --Authorization Request --> Google Authorization Server
   "Do you wish to authorize the app MyApp to access your Google username and profile?"

2. Authorization server responds with authorization grant (and code) to MyApp
   Authorization is granted and an authorization code is sent back
   ex: MyApp <--Authorization Grant-- Google Authorization Server

3. App sends Authorization Grant (and code) to Google Authorization Server to request access token
   ex: MyApp --Authorization Grant (and code) --> Google Authorization Server

4. Authorization server responds with access token to MyApp
   Token will provide user with access to requested resources only (username & profile)
   ex: MyApp <--Authorization Grant-- Google Authorization Server

5. App sends request to Google `Resource` Server with included access token to get resources
   ex: MyApp --resource request (and access token) --> Google Resource Server

6. Google resource server reads access token to identify this user is allowed to access only those agreed upon protected resources. Responds with those protected resources
   ex: MyApp <--Protected Resources-- Google Resource Server

for this to work, myApp must register with Google and share name, website and callback URL (the url where the user will be redirected once they have been authorized)

Upon registering, API will give client (MyApp) Credentials:
Client ID
Client Secret

express.session

1.  install and require express-session
2.  create session for every server request
    app.use(session({
    secret: '',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialize: false,
    }))
3.  regenerate a session (good practice for guarding against forms of session fixation)
    req.session.regenerate(function (err) {
    if (err) next(err)

        // store user information in session, typically a user id
        req.session.user = req.body.user

        // save the session before redirection to ensure page
        // load does not happen before session is saved
        req.session.save(function (err) {
          if (err) return next(err)
          res.redirect('/')
        })

    })

4.  middleware to test if authenticated:
    `if (req.session.user) return next()`
5.  middleware to logout user
    // clear the user from the session object and save.
    // this will ensure that re-using the old session id
    // does not have a logged in user
    req.session.username = null;
    req.session.save((error) => {
    if (error) return next({})
    // regenerate the session, which is good practice to help
    // guard against forms of session fixation
    req.session.regenerate((error) => {
    if (error) next(error);
    res.redirect('/');
    })
    })

loading animation:

1. create a pure css animation in CSS. give it class name: loading
2. create hidden class to set display: hidden.
3. create loading useState(true)
4. in useEffect, after fetching and getting data, setLoading(false)
5. conditionally render a `<span className={`loader ${!loading && 'hidden'}`}></span>`
6. we can now also conditionally render components based on loading
