Paired with Erika Jung - reminded me of the nullish coallescing operator

```
leftExpr ?? rightExpr       // if leftExpr is truthy, returns leftExpr
                            // if leftExpr is falsy, returns rightExpr
```

Use of `.constructor`:

```
const copy = new testObject.constructor  // uses the constructor to make a copy of the datatype
```

- Learned HashTables

- Array.unshift(1, 2, 3) = [1, 2, 3, ...Array]

# Day 4 - Feb 2

- `this.head = this.tail = newNode` assigns both `this.head` and `this.tail` to `newNode`

- hash O(n) solution to Two Sum(numArr, target):

```
hash= {};
iterate over numArr check what number is needed to match to target
if number is in hash - return both indices
otherwise add curr element to hash { element: index}
```

`.repeat()` - string method that constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified numbers of copies of the string on which it was called

approach to binary convertor
Given a string that represents a Binary Number, write a function that converts this string into a decimal number. DO NOT use the native parseInt() method.

For example:

binToDec('0') -> 0
binToDec('11') -> 3
binToDec('100') -> 4
binToDec('101') -> 5
binToDec('0101') -> 5

```
function binToDec(binString){
    let output = 0;
    for (const digit of binString){
        output *= 2;
        output += Number(digit);
    }
    return output;
```

`console.time(label)` start timer of name label
`console.timeEnd(label)` end timer of name label

isPrime() - check all divisors up to Math.sqrt(num) for efficiency

fibonacci bottom up approach:

- w/cache. cache = {0:0, 1:1}. cache[num] = cache[num - 2] + cache[num - 1]
- space: O(1): twoBefore = 0, oneBefore = 1. update values as you go

**factorial could be the same**

"Every single dynamic programming video should start out with the explanation of the subproblem.
This is not about table behind me. Itâ€™s about subproblem and how they relate to each other.

- `element.onclick = function(e) {}` <------ overwrites any existing functionality for click
- `element.addEvenetListener(eventType, function(event) {})` <------- preferred since it ADDS functionality vs overwrites
