## host vs server vs client

`host` - a device that connects to the network.  Could be desktop, laptop, smartphone, etc.  The hosting machine contains software tha enables it to communicate over the network.  Every device in the network has an IP address which helps identify the device in the network.  Devices can send data to other devices using this IP address.

A host shares and consumes resources

**NOTE:** not all devices are hosts.  Devices such as hubs, switches and routers do not have an IP address and, therefore, are not hosts.

`server` - a software or hardware device that provides services to other devices in the network.  A server can connect multiple clients. It is possible to run the client, and the server in the same device or the server can be a separate physical device as well. 

A server shares resources and provides services

`client` - a software or hardware that obtains services of a server.  A single client can connect to multiple servers.It is possible to run the client, and the server in the same device or the server can be a separate physical device as well. 

**CONCLUSION:** The basic difference between host and server is that host is a computer or other device that connects to the network while a server is a software or a hardware device that provides services to other programs or devices in the network.
