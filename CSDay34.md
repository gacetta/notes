# OSP Lecture
`T-shaped` developer.  solid in most, expert in one
- great teams are many T-shaped developers
- shows potential to be expert in something -> anything
- use as a signal of your ability in interviews

Show you are ready to contribute to solving demanding engineering problems that engineers interviewing you can related to (problem solving that engineers actually value)

Take into account different team members' priorities and maintain a realistic scope.

# experience valued by enginerrs
`80/20 rule` - pareto principle
- 80% of the feature is done in 20% of the time
- remaining 20% takes 80% of the time.

- Final 20% is the hard engineering and edge cases
- Take an app from being generic "react user auth app" to a specific tool that product/company - requring tackling challenges like:
- reduce rendering time
- consistency of complex state changes
- sophisticated UI features

## getting experience in final 20%
1. many of the edge cases only become visible with lots of users and data
- usually need users.  This is why some developers call projects without users 'toy apps'
2. Final 20% is less satisfying so most devs (on projects without user pressure) will not finish the hard edge cases of features and instead work on new features which are more fun (and only get those to 80% too...)

## effective way to gain experience with serious engineering challenges
- client products with users baked-in so that there's data to identify that 20%
- dev libraries, tools and services.  Build tools that solve those 'hard' challenges not only for one product but for devs working on the hard challenges of many products

## Dev Libraries
code that has been pre-written by someone else, published, and you can use

## dev tools and integrations
tools to help solve problems and automate tasks in the dev process
- postman
- redux devtools
- travis cl

## dev services
provide an ongoing hosted portion of a live application (as a service)

some of the most prominent and successful companies are dev services
- aws, mlab, algolia, twilio

interesting area but you need to be smart about how you avoid it being financially costly to your team
1. sandbox or rate limit
2. actually charge for the service
- comes with its own challenges

## open source labs tech accelerator
- open source products are contributed by engineering leaders in the community
- codesmith residents have the opportunity to apply to work on an existing OS Labs product
- current OSLabs primary repos
  - reactime, prevue, swell, overvue, reactype, chronos, spearmint, nautilus, quell, recoilize, obsidian, and others
- approved open source products are part of OS Labs Beta
- Every quearter OSLabs board votes OS Labs beta product to be selected to become permanently maintained as part of OS Labs

## how to ideate on dev libraries, tools, services

what are devs missing?
- hn.algolia.com (searchable Hacker News) Reddit, Medium, Stackoverflow
- Github trending (open issues)

What has been done but you could do differently, better or simplified DX (dev experience)?
- github trending projects (including non-js)
- producthunt lists (dev tools)

What's New that needs tooling?
- conferences (JS, Node, Devops), HN etc.
- caution around Google (often too complex topics)

## What makes a gret OSP
**FINISHING IS NOT THE GOAL**

- focusing on developing powerful storeis of mature engineerng judgement calls and deep-diving on technology

- building dev-oriented products in key web software engineering areas (UI frameworks, Node, DevOps)

- build an 'adjacent' fullstack React/Node web app (perhaps for rendering data of your dev tool or if a library, to enable a user to get an API key)
  - this enables you to reference your OSP when asked about core web techs

## what is less effective OSP
- focus too much on 'finishing' instead of dev engineering narratives
- products in ML, AR, VR, Blockchain (hard to become T-shaped in these areas when starting from zero)
- Worry about originality (there are 50 Node.js web frameworks - each offers something different)
- Network effect user base applications (the engineering should be the hardest work)

## what is also surprisingly less effective in the OSP
Things that are currently challenging, and soon won't be:
- convertors (React ->  Angular) - either so customizable that it's better to write the code or too basic to be usable
- visualizers of things that are often considered too 'easy' to understand from text (git history, SQL databases) - other visualizers are great
- config file generators - lots of 'if/else' statements in response to user input

These might reinforce biases from interviewers of inexperience

## how to succeed
- *you must feel excited and passionate about what you are building*
- if you proposed something that's not ideal but you're truly passionate about it, it will be approved
- what matters most is that you bring all your energy to the coming weeks and that relies on your passion and commitmnet
