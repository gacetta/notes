Javier Sacremento:

CSS:
- GLOBAL RESET could include `::before` and `::after`
- custom properties 
  - should be in `:root {}`
  - include numbers as CSS Variables (I see height and width and margins and paddings, etc. in px)

HTML:
  - ! + tab (emmet).  <head> could include <meta name='viewport' etc.>
  - <title> in <head>
  - good semantic html.  is <section> used correctly?  or is the <div> in line 18 the <section>?
  - id=#hero naming convention?  Better option - header?
