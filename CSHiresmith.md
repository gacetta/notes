recruitors check do you have:
picture
contribution history

## Best Practices

GH should be clean and ready for potential employers and colleagues to view

## Easy TO DOs

Follow everyone one of your cohortmates
Star 3+ of your cohortmates top projects (ask which ones)
Star at least 10 major projects you like:

- monaco-graphql
- react flow
- graphvinci
- framer-motion
- Ensured all your cohortmates have followed you.
  Ensured all your cohortmates have starred your choice projects
  Add image to your Organizations

## Detailed TO DO

- Add a test folder to each of your top 3 most starred and 2 most recent projects (and have tests written for them).
- Commented your code in the top 3 projects.
- JSLinted your code for your top 3 projects (and include an `eslintrc` file or equivalent). (prettier and beautify?)
- A README.md in the rood of each project directory.

### File Structure

in root directory:

- .gitignore
- package.json
- Readme.md

Whatever structure you use for testing, keep it consistent

### Tests

Top 3 projects should have tests and show your ability to write test code.

- Are you someone who will easily integrate into a team?
- can you work in TDD and BDD workflows?
- Does your coding approach

### Comments

Make sure code is commented in a clear and readable way. This shows that you can think clearly about the code you're writing

- Add comments for each function and large code block.
- Add comments describing function parameters and return values.
- The best comments explain 'why' more so than 'how' or 'what'. The latter should be clear from your code.

Check out slide for a link to JSDoc which can used to automatically generate documentation for your code.

### README.md

Include a README.md file in the root of each project directory

Include the following:

- Summary
- Screenshots
- How to get started
- How to run tests

### Other Suggestions

Logs:

- Remove all embarrassing console log messages.

Git Commit Messages:

- Clear and descriptive
- Individual files have different messages.
- How to edit commit messages:
