# What is JavaScript

an `executable` is essentially a file that runs and does something

- if JS is attacehd to an html, it's front-end code.  The code runs in the browser
- if not, it's not front-end code.  The code does NOT run in the browser, but somewhere else.
- JS can only be changed to machine code by a `js engine`
- the `place` where javascript runs is called the `runtime environment`, or `runtime` for short.
- for "normal" JS, it's in browsers.  All browsers have js engines (v8, spidermonkey)
- for backend code, it's called `node`, which uses the same engine that chrome uses
