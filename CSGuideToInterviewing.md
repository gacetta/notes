# Guide To Interviewing

Dress up to get in the best mind set

Don't show your lack of confidence

Humor - be careful with 

---------
## Personal and Professional Narrative

Companies *do not* know how to assess your engineering ability

Interviewers have a rough sense they want someone who is:
- "smart, gets things done, and a good fit"

How to reliably assess this in as little as 20 minutes?  *it's almost impossible*

So interviewers fall back on:
- Heuristics (simplified mental models)
- Credentials
- How polished your answers are
- Your confidence
- (Worst of all) 'gut instinct'

We need to know how to navigate all this criteria

8/10 times - the phone screener is not a technology person

## You are *highly* effective software engineers ready for mid and senior roles

***It's not who knows the most in these roles***

PROBLEM SOLVING AUTONOMY
- can build a feature whether or not you've encountered the tech before
- builders not students
- core engineering fundamentals > memorizing code

JS, FRAMEWORKS & CS KNOWLEDGE
- under-the-hood JS knowledge (closure, event loop, OOP, etc)
- Specialists in core high-value tech - Node, React
- versatile programmers (computer science, object-oriented and functional paradigms, dev-ops)

TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION
- can talk through code or problem with clarity and precision
- can explain projects, technical decisions at a high level
- precise responses to technical questions

CULTURAL FIT & NON-TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION
- creative, empathetic people who help others
- thoughtful effective communicators - of code, ideas and passion

**Use HELP DESK form for daily work**  what is the problem, what have you tried, what did you expect, why do you think 

## Now you have to be an effective job searcher

The techniques in the hiring program will make you an effective job searcher:
- resume development
- development of technical narrative & online profiles
- application process
- interview strategies:
  - phone screens and general questions
  - technical questions
  - whiteboarding and code challenges
- offers and negotiations

## job search process

*application or inbound*
      v
*phone interview* ----- *take home project / assessment*
      v
*onsite interview*
      v
*offer/negotiation*

## anatomy of a phone screen (from recruiter or engineer)

General questions:
- "tell me your background" (focus of this workshop)

Questions about experience with key technologies:
- High level if with recruiter "what is your experience with Node.js"
- Deeper if with engineer "Explain to me how the even loop works"

(Sometimes) Algos or specific JS or technology questions

## Recruiter's mindset
OR - why recruiters ask your 'years of experience' but engineers don't

*Recruiter's goal:* Impress their boss (e.g. VP of Engineering)

*How?* Not by assessing actual technical ability (the recruiter is non-technical and has almost no understanding of the work you have done)

Instead, by an impression of you being 'credible' (sounding like other people the VP of Eng hired)

1. Ideal scenario: send candidate who comes across as credible
2. Next best: send candidate who does not come across as *credible* but has multiple years of experience in tech of job description
3. No go: candidate not credible & insufficient experience

If the recruiter asks your 'years of experience' you have not come across sufficiently credible and they're offering a lifeline.

*Interview is not going well: "how many years of experience do you have?"*

## How to show you are a highly credible candidate in interview
Or "how to control the interview"

1. Volunteer advanced technical stories and focus on mature engineering decisions
*connect a story with an answer* - much more powerful.  Volunteer _why_ you choose something

2. Speak humbly to your creditials and prestige
*humble* mixed in with confidence goes A LONG way

3. Focus on areas of your expertise (T-shaped developer)
by showing *deep expertise* in one area, creates assumption that you know many other techs at a base level

4. Always speak to the bigger picture and provide context
*why use a tech* and then give more specifics of projects you used that tech for

5. Have opinions but talk about trade-offs
*volunteer opinions* and talk trade offs

6. Know the company, space, interviewer - link your comments to them
*make it personal*

7. Ask 'informed opinion-questions' (never end an answer without a question) - Conversational style - these are not simple questions, they're comments that leave an opening for a response from the other party.
*steer the conversation*

<question + `the reason I ask is because` + informed/opinion>

## How to show you are **NOT** a highly credible candidate in interview
1. Not making it a conversation (Procedural interviewee)
- _short answers_ with the interviewer leading.  You face more and more tough questions as the interviewer tries to find something to talk about

2. Using undersell terms "I've only been doing this for..."
don't use: _tried_, _only_, _just_

3. Focusing on non-technical experience (know your context)
_depends who you're talking to_

4. Presenting yourself as a learner not active contributor
_"I'm really excited to learn from all the great engineers on your team"_
INSTEAD: "I'm really excited to contribute and work alongside this incredible team of engineers..."

5. Having low energy and physical cues
FIX: *stand up*, *lean in*, *don't rest face on your chin*, 

(95% of interviewees fall into this category)

## What do you need to show you are a credible candidate?
It's less than you think - you already have it

What do you need on the job?
- Ability to work with technologies in which you don't yet have expertise

What do you need in interview?
- Expertise in an area and the ability to speak to it well
- 'interview-polished' answers to core technologies
- Growth mentality to polish concepts that you were unpolished on in previous interviews
- High level general knowledge of most topics such that you can speak to them in a general manner

What do you absolutely not need in interview?
- Expertise in every topic that you would be expected to do on the job

## Pre-interview checklist
these are the 3 questions you must answer before (or during) every interview
1. What is the engineering background of the team, interviewer and leadership (companies, schools, technologies, talks, culture of teams they've worked for)
*linkedIn premium might help here*

2. What is the company's stack - how and why would/did they choose these technologies?  What trade-offs are faced with these technologies

3. What makes the company/product/engineering/culture distinctive (engineering culture, general culture, difference with market)

Find answers on: 
website, wappalyzer, angellist/linkedin, job description, HN.algolia.com & Medium, messaging with company's team members

## Post-Interview Iteration Process
1. Take Notes
note down all the questions from the interview (esp ones that were unpolished)

2. Research
Search "what are the advantages of react over vue" - look for thoughtful post

3. Understand trade-offs
Find agreeing and disagreeing responses

4. Get feedback & Experiment
Share your insights in Slack with your cohortmates.
Experiment with relevant tech - e.g. Research Vue syntax

## How to improve at interviewing
Create a table of different topics to work on polishing interview answers

1. Increate # of topics that are green (interview-polished) by going through the post-interview research & experiment process
2. Lead the interview and bring up where possible your green areas
3. Interview a lot - you can never get all topics to green so you need some luck too
4. Have a growth mindset - do not let interview dings get you down

TURN THOSE GREY SQUARES GREEN!

## How to not improve at interviewing

The only feedback you will receive is: "Not enough experience" or "not enough experience with [a technology on the job description]'

## Preparing your narrative about you as a software engineer

Main story
1. Introductory overview with focus on most recent work (OSP)
a. including your current focus (OSP) and how the role/company fits in
b. already should be turning it into a conversation about engineering
c. include:
  i. general statement of field of work and expertise (keep relevant to company)
  ii. any credentials (humble confidence)
  iii. why interested in company and their engineering culture
  iv. informed-opinion question to transition into a conversationi

After (1) you should be already turning it into a conversation about engineering

Other parts to prepare (not mandatory but good to have)
2. Anchor Point
3. Previous Experience
4. Codesmith

## Part 1: Your opening
Includes:
- general statement of field of work and expertise (keep it relevant to stack of company)
- any credentials (humble confidence)
  - University, prominent companies you worked with, etc.
- Why interested in company & their engineering culture
- Informed-Opinion question to transition into a conversation

## Part 2: Your Anchor Point
bring this up in the first few minutes

your goal is to give yourself a technical lineage (and avoid the bias against 'career changers'):
- web dev/CS/math/analytical

## Part 4: Your time at Codesmith
Focus on motivations that elevate you as a serious software engineer not a student
Identify your personal reason:
- community/network of other experience engineers
- Want to contribute to the OS community through OSLabs (reference your open source product and other successful products)
- change to build alongside engineers from every field (reference classmates expertise)

Interviewer: Laura Pang, Software Engineer at Figma
https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurapang/
- Worked at Facebook - graphQL

React.js including JSX, Context, Hooks (v16+)

- Open Source Tool for GraphQL developers, created under the umbrella of OSLabs tech accelerator.  

- I'm passionate about visual design and feedback, as was evident in our OSP.  React flow was a big component for implementing an interactive visualizer in our product.  Since Figma is a visual design tool, so it has piqued my interest.  I see that you're looking for react experience with JSX, Context and hooks.  Are there specific hooks that your engineers focus on more than others?  I ask because I recently got a lot of experience with the useRef() hook while working on our open source tool.  We were running into  react flow and monaco editor
