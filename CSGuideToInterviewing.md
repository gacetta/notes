# Guide To Interviewing

Dress up to get in the best mind set

Don't show your lack of confidence

Humor - be careful with 

---------
## Personal and Professional Narrative

Companies *do not* know how to assess your engineering ability

Interviewers have a rough sense they want someone who is:
- "smart, gets things done, and a good fit"

How to reliably assess this in as little as 20 minutes?  *it's almost impossible*

So interviewers fall back on:
- Heuristics (simplified mental models)
- Credentials
- How polished your answers are
- Your confidence
- (Worst of all) 'gut instinct'

We need to know how to navigate all this criteria

8/10 times - the phone screener is not a technology person

## You are *highly* effective software engineers ready for mid and senior roles

***It's not who knows the most in these roles***

PROBLEM SOLVING AUTONOMY
- can build a feature whether or not you've encountered the tech before
- builders not students
- core engineering fundamentals > memorizing code

JS, FRAMEWORKS & CS KNOWLEDGE
- under-the-hood JS knowledge (closure, event loop, OOP, etc)
- Specialists in core high-value tech - Node, React
- versatile programmers (computer science, object-oriented and functional paradigms, dev-ops)

TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION
- can talk through code or problem with clarity and precision
- can explain projects, technical decisions at a high level
- precise responses to technical questions

CULTURAL FIT & NON-TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION
- creative, empathetic people who help others
- thoughtful effective communicators - of code, ideas and passion

**Use HELP DESK form for daily work**  what is the problem, what have you tried, what did you expect, why do you think 

## Now you have to be an effective job searcher

The techniques in the hiring program will make you an effective job searcher:
- resume development
- development of technical narrative & online profiles
- application process
- interview strategies:
  - phone screens and general questions
  - technical questions
  - whiteboarding and code challenges
- offers and negotiations

## job search process

*application or inbound*
      v
*phone interview* ----- *take home project / assessment*
      v
*onsite interview*
      v
*offer/negotiation*

## anatomy of a phone screen (from recruiter or engineer)

General questions:
- "tell me your background" (focus of this workshop)

Questions about experience with key technologies:
- High level if with recruiter "what is your experience with Node.js"
- Deeper if with engineer "Explain to me how the even loop works"

(Sometimes) Algos or specific JS or technology questions

## Recruiter's mindset
OR - why recruiters ask your 'years of experience' but engineers don't

*Recruiter's goal:* Impress their boss (e.g. VP of Engineering)

*How?* Not by assessing actual technical ability (the recruiter is non-technical and has almost no understanding of the work you have done)

Instead, by an impression of you being 'credible' (sounding like other people the VP of Eng hired)

1. Ideal scenario: send candidate who comes across as credible
2. Next best: send candidate who does not come across as *credible* but has multiple years of experience in tech of job description
3. No go: candidate not credible & insufficient experience

If the recruiter asks your 'years of experience' you have not come across sufficiently credible and they're offering a lifeline.

*Interview is not going well: "how many years of experience do you have?"*

Podcast to listen to: *The Pivot*

## How to show you are a highly credible candidate in interview
Or "how to control the interview"

1. Volunteer advanced technical stories and focus on mature engineering decisions
*connect a story with an answer* - much more powerful.  Volunteer _why_ you choose something

2. Speak humbly to your creditials and prestige
*humble* mixed in with confidence goes A LONG way

3. Focus on areas of your expertise (T-shaped developer)
by showing *deep expertise* in one area, creates assumption that you know many other techs at a base level

4. Always speak to the bigger picture and provide context
*why use a tech* and then give more specifics of projects you used that tech for

5. Have opinions but talk about trade-offs
*volunteer opinions* and talk trade offs

6. Know the company, space, interviewer - link your comments to them
*make it personal*

7. Ask 'informed opinion-questions' (never end an answer without a question) - Conversational style - these are not simple questions, they're comments that leave an opening for a response from the other party.
*steer the conversation*

<question + `the reason I ask is because` + informed/opinion>

## How to show you are **NOT** a highly credible candidate in interview
1. Not making it a conversation (Procedural interviewee)
- _short answers_ with the interviewer leading.  You face more and more tough questions as the interviewer tries to find something to talk about

2. Using undersell terms "I've only been doing this for..."
don't use: _tried_, _only_, _just_

3. Focusing on non-technical experience (know your context)
_depends who you're talking to_

4. Presenting yourself as a learner not active contributor
_"I'm really excited to learn from all the great engineers on your team"_
INSTEAD: "I'm really excited to contribute and work alongside this incredible team of engineers..."

5. Having low energy and physical cues
FIX: *stand up*, *lean in*, *don't rest face on your chin*, 

(95% of interviewees fall into this category)

## What do you need to show you are a credible candidate?
It's less than you think - you already have it

What do you need on the job?
- Ability to work with technologies in which you don't yet have expertise

What do you need in interview?
- Expertise in an area and the ability to speak to it well
- 'interview-polished' answers to core technologies
- Growth mentality to polish concepts that you were unpolished on in previous interviews
- High level general knowledge of most topics such that you can speak to them in a general manner

What do you absolutely not need in interview?
- Expertise in every topic that you would be expected to do on the job

## Pre-interview checklist
these are the 3 questions you must answer before (or during) every interview
1. What is the engineering background of the team, interviewer and leadership (companies, schools, technologies, talks, culture of teams they've worked for)
*linkedIn premium might help here*

2. What is the company's stack - how and why would/did they choose these technologies?  What trade-offs are faced with these technologies

3. What makes the company/product/engineering/culture distinctive (engineering culture, general culture, difference with market)

Find answers on: 
website, wappalyzer, angellist/linkedin, job description, HN.algolia.com & Medium, messaging with company's team members

## Post-Interview Iteration Process
1. Take Notes
note down all the questions from the interview (esp ones that were unpolished)

2. Research
Search "what are the advantages of react over vue" - look for thoughtful post

3. Understand trade-offs
Find agreeing and disagreeing responses

4. Get feedback & Experiment
Share your insights in Slack with your cohortmates.
Experiment with relevant tech - e.g. Research Vue syntax

## How to improve at interviewing
Create a table of different topics to work on polishing interview answers

1. Increate # of topics that are green (interview-polished) by going through the post-interview research & experiment process
2. Lead the interview and bring up where possible your green areas
3. Interview a lot - you can never get all topics to green so you need some luck too
4. Have a growth mindset - do not let interview dings get you down

TURN THOSE GREY SQUARES GREEN!

## How to not improve at interviewing

The only feedback you will receive is: "Not enough experience" or "not enough experience with [a technology on the job description]'

## Preparing your narrative about you as a software engineer

Main story
1. Introductory overview with focus on most recent work (OSP)
a. including your current focus (OSP) and how the role/company fits in
b. already should be turning it into a conversation about engineering
c. include:
  i. general statement of field of work and expertise (keep relevant to company)
  ii. any credentials (humble confidence)
  iii. why interested in company and their engineering culture
  iv. informed-opinion question to transition into a conversationi

After (1) you should be already turning it into a conversation about engineering

Other parts to prepare (not mandatory but good to have)
2. Anchor Point
3. Previous Experience
4. Codesmith

## Part 1: Your opening
Includes:
- general statement of field of work and expertise (keep it relevant to stack of company)
- any credentials (humble confidence)
  - University, prominent companies you worked with, etc.
- Why interested in company & their engineering culture
- Informed-Opinion question to transition into a conversation

## Part 2: Your Anchor Point
bring this up in the first few minutes

your goal is to give yourself a technical lineage (and avoid the bias against 'career changers'):
- web dev/CS/math/analytical

## Part 4: Your time at Codesmith
Focus on motivations that elevate you as a serious software engineer not a student
Identify your personal reason:
- community/network of other experience engineers
- Want to contribute to the OS community through OSLabs (reference your open source product and other successful products)
- change to build alongside engineers from every field (reference classmates expertise)

## Guide to Answering Technical Questions

Framework of how to answer a technical question

## Types of technical questions:

Less narrative-based:

- what does this code log to the console?
- how could we add a method to an object without directly mutating the object
- how does the virtual dom work
- how does the event loop work?
- what is a JS class?
- what is a closure?

More narrative-based:

- What's your experience with Node?
- Tell me your frontend dev experience?
- How much have you worked with databases?
- How do you work on a team effectively?
- How do you build reliable systems?

## Goal of interview asking technical questions
An attempt to assess your experience and readiness to contribute on the job.

Your answers are an opportunity for you to show your:
- expertise in certain technologies:
 - T-Shaped developer shows you can be come expert *this is high value*
- Mature engineering judgement (best practices)
  - I built it in React because that's all I know (eek)
- You have to be your own promoter but in a sensitive way (credible but humble)

## 5 steps to answering technical narrative questions

1. (before interview) Prepare
2. Make the interviewer care about your answer
3. Formulate a structured answer with good judgments
4. Volunteer a question or opinion
5. Review & follow interview iteration process

## Step 1 - Prepare
Do these before you even walk into the interview

You can iterate on your understanding of these questions in conversation during the interview

- Go through the pre-interview checklist
1. what's the background of the team, interviewer and leadership
2. What's the company's stack
3. What makes the company or engineering culture distinctive

- Prepare your answers beforehand (but be ready to adjust them to each interview question)

1. Write you prepared answers down
2. Get em down pat!
3. Make them your own through repetition (but not just reading them)

## Step 2 - Make the interviewer care about your answer
*setup for the answer*
By linking it to a product/situation and explain its significance and seriousness

Make your answer powerful by relating it to your work or product
`
Tell me your experience with node?
- Describe a specific product in which you used Node
How does closure work?
- Share a situation in which you used closure

Details of product
- Team & general technologies
- Why did you build the product - share you motivation as an engineer

What made the product significant?
- Important problem for developers
- Groundbreaking technology
- Traction (users/dev engagement)
  - Reddit discussions, direct feedback from engineers, stars, claps on medium articles, etc.

  ## Step 3: Structure answer & provide good judgments
  Now it's time to answer the question directly
  (a) Structure your answer with numbers  *Sign-posting*
  - There are 3 main goals I have when choosing a UI framework and that led me to choose React...

  (b) Focus on mature engineering judgment calls adn motivations
  - "react abstracts my interaction with DOM and lets me think of state changes 21throughout the render lifecycle"
  - Diagramming 
  - remember client optimizations vs. dev optimizations

  (c) Relate your answer to the company/role/interviewer
  - "has your team thought about incorporating hooks?"

  (d) identify the shortcomings before your interviewer does and talk through them to demonstrate that you know why they are shortcomings.  *Hedging*
  - "had we foreseen the scale we achieved I'd have done X"
  - "Redux was probably not necessary in hindsight"

  ### Examples of engineering motivbations
  make sure to speak to specifically how a given tech/choice you made improved these

  Improved User Experience (Client Optimizations)
  *often lead to follow up questions about how you measured this*
  - improved render time
  - reduced server latency
  - consistency of UX
  - accessibility
  - improved device performance

  Improved Dev Experience
  *same weight as client optimization but it's opinion so no follow up*
  - modularized code
  - easier debugging
  - easier testing
  - code maintainability
  - improved error handling
  - reduced 'ramp-up' time - *fancy way to acknowledge you didn't know other frameworks*

  ## Step 4: Volunteer a question or opinion (check in)
  Share an opinion-question:
  - "What's been your team's experience with Node and debugging around asynchronicity?  I ask because I've found promises effective but also, actually understanding the event loop and task queue setup is most effective"

  - "I know your team is in the processes of refactoring your app in React.  How has that experience been for you?  I've found that React's declarative architecture does remove some of the direct control you have as an engineering team, but in an easily manageable way"

  Offer to go into further depth:
  - "I'm happy to go into more depth if you like" *fail-safe*

## Practice

Company: Figma -  senior web developer.  full-time mid-senior role
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3536508005&keywords=frontend%20developer&refresh=true
Interviewer: Laura Pang, Software Engineer at Figma
https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurapang/
MIT -> Google -> Facebook (GraphQL) -> Figma

Looking for React.js engineer experienced in JSX, Context, Hooks (v16+)

*Tech Stack:* JS, Node.Js, React, NGINX, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, Ruby, C++
*Mission statement:* Our vision is to make design accessible to everyone

Tell me about your React experience?

A team of engineers and I recently built an open source tool, called GraphQL One Stop Shop.  We noticed there are several popular GraphQL dev tools that provide different functionality.  Tools like GraphiQl helps with query/mutation generation & testing whereas a tool such as GraphQL Voyager helps visualize a schema.  *I see that you previously worked at facebook, so maybe you're familiar with these GraphQL tools*  We decided to combine the functionality of these two tools, and integrate them in one place for real time data and visual feedback.  One of the early decisions we had to make was how we wanted to build out the front end.  We had several options we could have gone with - Angular, Vue, React, but we ultimately opted for React for 3 main reasons

1. State management.  Since we had two sides of our application referencing the same schema data, the unidirectional data flow of React allowed us to have one centralized source of truth for both the editor and visualizer to reference. Any change to that data was simply passed downstream to the necessary components to re-render as necessary.
2. Optimized re-rendering via the Virtual DOM.  We wanted to build a dynamic interactive visualizer with the ability to drag & collapse custom nodes. We utilized React Flow library to streamline this process.  It takes advantage of React's use of the virtual DOM for selective component re-rendering which was optimal for smoothly rendering nodes & edges as they are relocated on the page, while leaving other elements untouched.  
3. Conditional rendering. the user was given a great deal of options to customize the tool: they could toggle which parts of the schema they wanted to view, hide different elements on the page - such as the minimap to name a couple.  Performance metrics were also displayed based on successful response from GraphQL apis.  Conditional rendering of these components based on the centralized state was quite straightforward for the dev team thanks to React.

Overall, our team hit all our MVPs and we're proud of it.  We're now working on stretch features such as the ability to generate a query by clicking on the schema which is definitely creating some challenges, but we love challenges.  I really enjoyed making a visualizer, i love that stuff.  In fact, figma is one of the tools I use when visualizing my design, so I'm super excited to be here

One downside we experienced using the useState hook in conjunction with useEffect caused issues with stale state.  So in hindsight it might have been a good idea for us to implement some sort of global state management such as redux or useContext().

I see figma's frontend is built using React as well.  How do you manage state?  I ask because one downside we experienced in our app was the useState() hook in conjunction with useEffect() caused issues with stale state.  So in hindsight it might have been a good idea for us to implement some sort of global state management.  Do you use stateful class components, functional components with hooks, or some global alternative like redux or zustrand?

(c) Relate your answer to the company/role/interviewer
- "has your team thought about incorporating hooks?"


## Step 5: Review & Iterate
Suppose you were asked: "what are the advantages of React over Vue?  What now?"

Same as before:
(a) Take notes
- note down all the questions from the interview (esp ones that were unpolished)
(b) research
- search "what are the advantages of React over Angular" - look for thoughtful post
- medium, hn.algolia, etc.
(c) Understand trade-offs (this helps hedging)
- find agreeing and disagreeing responses
(d) Get feedback & experiment
- share your insights in Slack with your cohortmates.
- experiment with relavant tech - e.g. build things in Angular and React

## What makes a great answer
Technical communication
- precise and specific
- give context for your audience
Keep it conversational by asking questions
- volunteer further depth - you can always share more
Have opinions but make sure to provide the context or hedge
*Show passion and excitement*

## what to avoid
- undersell words: "i only touched x", "as beginners it was hard, I kinda did x"
- short answers - although remember to check with the interviewer if they want you to keep on diving in
- "I've never worked with that" -> Volunteer a story related (remember your context)
